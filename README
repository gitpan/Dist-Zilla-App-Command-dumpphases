DESCRIPTION
    Working out what Plugins will execute in which order during which phase
    can be a little confusing sometimes.

    This Command exists primarily to make developing Plugin Bundles and
    debugging dist.ini a bit easier, especially for newbies who may not
    fully understand Bundles yet.
